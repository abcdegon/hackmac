# hackmac

I started *hackmac* as a weekend project. The idea behind it was: <br>
1. to stay in touch which practical security
2. try to learn a new programming language (Python)
3. try to get experience running Docker containers

Every single tool will be documented here.

## Setup
Create a virtual environment.

```
sh>python3 -m venv hackenv
sh>pip3 install --upgrade pip
```
